### xSQLServerScript

Provides the means to run a user generated T-SQL script on the SQL Server instance. Three scripts are required; Get T-SQL script, Set T-SQL script and the Test T-SQL script.

| T-SQL Script | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| Get  | The Get T-SQL script is used to query the status when running the cmdlet Get-DscConfiguration, and the result can be found in the property `GetResult`. |
| Test | The Test T-SQL script is used to test if the desired state is met. If Test T-SQL raises an error or returns any value other than 'null' the test fails, thus the Set T-SQL script is run. |
| Set  | The Set T-SQL script performs the actual change when Test T-SQL script fails. |

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server 2008 or later.
* Target machine must have access to the SQLPS PowerShell module or the SqlServer PowerShell module.

_Note: There is a known problem running this resource using PowerShell 4.0. See [issue #273](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/273) for more information._

#### Parameters

* **[String] ServerInstance** _(Key)_: The name of an instance of the Database Engine. For a default instance, only specify the computer name. For a named instances, use the format ComputerName\\InstanceName.
* **[String] SetFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Set action.
* **[String] GetFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Get action. Any values returned by the T-SQL queries will also be returned by the cmdlet Get-DscConfiguration through the `GetResult` property.
* **[String] TestFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Test action. Any script that does not throw an error or returns null is evaluated to true. The cmdlet Invoke-SqlCmd treats T-SQL Print statements as verbose text, and will not cause the test to return false.
* **[PSCredential] Credential** _(Write)_: The credentials to authenticate with, using SQL Authentication. To authenticate using Windows Authentication, assign the credentials to the built-in parameter `PsDscRunAsCredential`. If both parameters `Credential` and `PsDscRunAsCredential` are not assigned, then SYSTEM account will be used to authenticate using Windows Authentication.
* **[String[]] Variable** _(Write)_: Specifies, as a string array, a sqlcmd scripting variable for use in the sqlcmd script, and sets a value for the variable. Use a Windows PowerShell array to specify multiple variables and their values. For more information how to use this, please go to the help documentation for [Invoke-Sqlcmd](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683370.aspx).

#### Read-Only Properties from Get-TargetResource
