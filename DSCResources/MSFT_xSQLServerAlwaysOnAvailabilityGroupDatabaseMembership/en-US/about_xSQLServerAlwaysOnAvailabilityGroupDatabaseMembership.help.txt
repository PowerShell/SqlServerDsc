SYNOPSIS
    Adds or removes databases to the specified availability group.

PARAMETER DatabaseName
    The name of the database(s) that should be members of the availability group. The availability 
    group member database(s) are added and removed until they match the defined databases. This 
    accepts wildcards.

PARAMETER DatabaseNameToInclude
    The name of the database(s) that should be added to the availability group. The defined 
    database(s) are added to the availability group. All other databases that may be a member of 
    the availability group are ignored. This accepts wildcards.

PARAMETER DatabaseNameToExclude
    The name of the database(s) that should be removed from the availability group. The defined 
    database(s) are removed to the availability group. All other databases that may be a member of 
    the availability group are ignored. This accepts wildcards.

PARAMETER SQLServer
    Hostname of the SQL Server where the primary replica of the availability group lives. If the
    availability group is not currently on this server, the resource will attempt to connect to the
    server where the primary replica lives.

PARAMETER SQLInstanceName
    Name of the SQL instance where the primary replica of the availability group lives. If the
    availability group is not currently on this instance, the resource will attempt to connect to
    the instance where the primary replica lives.

PARAMETER AvailabilityGroupName
    The name of the availability group in which to manage the database membership(s).

PARAMETER BackupPath
    The path used to seed the availability group replicas. This should be a path that is accessible
    by all of the replicas.

PARAMETER MatchDatabaseOwner
    If set to $true, this ensures the database owner of the database on the primary replica is the
    owner of the database on all secondary replicas. This requires the database owner is available
    as a login on all replicas and that the PSDscRunAsAccount has impersonate permissions.

    If set to $false, the owner of the database will be the PSDscRunAsAccount.

    The default is '$true'.
